Hi Everyone!  I am a 46 year old woman who has two kids and a terrific husband, Larry. Yikes, it's hard to read the 46 year old woman part.

Hunter is my fourth German Shepherd.  His beloved predecessors are Hobbes, Otto, and Gunner.  Hunter is an unusual character...

We also have a cat, our first ever.  Shadow sleeps and eats.
